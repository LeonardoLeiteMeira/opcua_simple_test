# OPC UA
This is a simple implementation of OPC-UA protocol

I have created this repository to study and create some tests. 

The folder OPC UA Abtractrion is a group of classes that I'll use to modeling my servers, so it's more organized and easier to understand than the other files.

To run `main.py` file in `opc_ua_abstraction`folder is necessary to run the file `servers.py` in mult_servers folder


### Next steps
1. Insert subscription handler at the abstraction
2. Create way to export the data (maybe MQTT)
3. Create way to receive comands - run methods
